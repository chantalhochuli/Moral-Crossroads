We're sitting on the rooftop, the wine staining our lips red and cigarette smoke is floating in the air. You are married. But yet you give me your full attention. I enjoyed the time spent together at the concert earlier.
You're married. To another woman. And yet you are here with me.

You put your arm around me and pull me closer. We keep on talking. It feels so natural, yet so wrong. You're married. I know that you have an open relationship but I have a lot of respect for your wife. I'm passive. You’re married. You start hugging me intensely. I'm passive. You’re married. You seduce me. You're married. I have to say something! You're married. Do I have to say something? You’re married. What should I say and what not? You're married. My head can't focus. Words come and go. Is your wife really okay with this? You’re married. I try to focus, connecting letters in my head to build a phrase. I'm not sure what to say or not. You're married. I don't want to hurt your wife. You're married. I enjoy your presence. Our lips touch for the bliss of a second. You're married. I don’t want to kiss you. I want to kiss you. You're married. Words come and go, deconstruct and reconnect. You're married. I need to start the conversation. You're married. "Did you talk with her about this and are you both ok with what is happening here? You're married!"
